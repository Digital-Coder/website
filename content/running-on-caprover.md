- No lock-in! Remove CapRover and your apps keep working!
- Docker Swarm under the hood for containerization and clustering

## Setup

Setup of [CapRover Umami](https://github.com/tschannik/caprover-umami) is fairly easy. Follow the steps below to set up a Umami on CapRover:

### 1. Visit your CapRover Dashboard

Login to your existing capcover instance account at `captain.your-sub-domain.your-domain.xx`

If you don't have an existing CapRover instance check out their docs at [CapRover - Get Started](https://caprover.com/docs/get-started.html)

### 2. Create app from template

Click on the "Apps" section of your CapRover instance.
Now select "One-Click Apps/Databases" and search for Umami and select it.

### 3. Setup Umami

After selecting Umami from the CapRover One-Click Apps you'll be prompted with a setup page where you can specify some env variables. Notice how most of them are already configured.

- `App Name` is the display name for your Umami instance in CapRover
- `PostgreSQL Version` can be any PostgreSQL version available on [PostgreSQL - Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres). The default value has successfully been tested to work with Umami.
- `CapRover Umami Version` refers to the CapRover Umami package found on [caprover-umami Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tschannik/caprover-umami/tags). CapRover Umami ensures the correct setup of Umami on CapRover by pulling a PostgreSQL build of Umami and some checks to prevent whiping your data on restart or updates. Please have a look at the supported versions.
- `Potgress Database password` provides the used password for your PostgreSQL database. There will always be a default value ready for you.
- Optional: `Arguments for 'PostgreSQL initdb'` you can also provide arguments for PostgreSQL initdb like for example `--data-checksums`

Now just click on "Deploy" to start the setup of your CapRover Umami instance.
Please do not leave the page until it's done.

### 4. Final checkouts

You're now able to login to your Umami deployment at `app-name.your-sub-domain.your-domain.xx` as described in the [Login](/docs/login) section. Please immediately change your password on the profile page.
