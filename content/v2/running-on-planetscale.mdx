# Running on PlanetScale

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a MySQL-compatible serverless database platform powered by [Vitess](https://vitess.io/).

## Setup

1. Fork the [https://github.com/umami-software/umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) project to your GitHub account and pull it into your machine.
2. Create a database on [PlanetScale](https://app.planetscale.com/) called `umami-db` and copy the `DATABASE_URL` string from "Connect" > "Connect with Prisma" > ".env" tab.
3. Add the `DATABASE_URL` to your `.env` file:

    ```properties
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@host/umami-db?sslaccept=strict
    ```

4. Run `npm install` and then `npm run build-db && npm run update-db`.
5. Visit the `umami-db` dashboard and make sure the Tables are created and then promote it to production if you want.
6. You should now be able to build and start Umami (`npm run build` followed by `npm start`).
7. Follow the **Getting started** guide starting from the [Login](/docs/login) step and be sure to change the default password.

### Troubleshooting

If are getting an error like the following example:

```text
PrismaClientInitializationError: Can't reach database server at `host.aws-region.psdb.cloud`:`3306`
```

You can try add a connection timeout query parameter on your `DATABASE_URL`:

```properties
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@host/umami-db?sslaccept=strict&connect_timeout=300
```
