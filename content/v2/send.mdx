## `POST /api/collect`

To register an `event`, you need to send a `POST` to `/api/send` with
the following data:

## `POST /api/send`

**Parameters**

-- `payload`

- `hostname`: Name of host.
- `language`: (string) Language of visitor (ex. "en-US")
- `referrer`: (string) Name of referrer.
- `screen`: (string) Screen resolution (ex. "1920x1080")
- `title`: (string) Name of Page Title.
- `url`: (string) Name of URL.
- `website`: (string) Website Id.

-- `type`: (string) `event` is currently the only type available.

**Sample payload**

```
{
    payload: {
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        referrer: "",
        screen: "1920x1080",
        title: "dashboard"
        url: "/",
        website: "your-website-id",
    },
    type: "event"
}
```

For events, from v1.37 onwards, you would send:

```
{
    payload: {
        website: "your-website-id",
        url: "/",
        event_name: "click-signup-button",
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        screen: "1920x1080"
    },
    type: "event"
}
```

Note, for `/api/send` requests you do not need to send an
authentication token.

Also, you need to send a proper `User-Agent` HTTP header or
your request won't be registered.
