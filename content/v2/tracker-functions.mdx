# Tracker functions

The Umami tracker exposes a function that you can call on your website if you want
more control over your tracking.

```
umami.track(event_name, [event_data])
```

### Pageview

Tracks a page view.

```
umami.track();
```

### Event

Tracks an event with a given name.

```
umami.track('Signup button');
```

### Event Data

Tracks an event with dynamic data.

```
umami.track('Signup button', { data: { name: 'umami', id: 123 }});
```

Dynamic data must be placed within the `data` property. Unrecognized properties placed outside of the `data` property will be ignored.

Properties already collected by the tracker can be overriden.

```
umami.track('Signup button', { language: 'fr-FR' });
```

Properties automatically collected by the tracker include `hostname`, `language`, `referrer`, `screen`, `title`, `url`, and `website`.

### Event Data Limits

Event Data can work with any JSON data. There are a few rules in place to maintain performance.

- Numbers have a max precision of 4.
- Strings have a max length of 500.
- Arrays are converted to a String, with the same max length of 500.
- Dynamic objects have a max length of 50 properties. Arrays are considered 1 property.
