# Funnel

Umami Funnel helps you understand the conversion and drop-off rate of users.
By analyzing the funnel, users can make informed decisions to optimize the website's user experience and achieve better conversion rates.

The report works by displaying the counts of users that reach each URL and the drop off rate from the previous step.
The funnel uses specific order criteria, which requires step completion in a required order.
The user may navigate to other URLs in between the funnel steps, but must complete the funnel steps in order to be counted as a conversion.

## Parameters

- `Website`: (required) The website you want to run the report on.
- `Date range`: (required) The date range of the report.
- `Window`: (required) Amount of minutes a user has between funnel conditions to be counted as a conversion.
- `URLs`: (required) Sequential URL conditions used in the funnel. Minimum of two is required to run the report.
