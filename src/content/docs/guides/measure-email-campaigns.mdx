# Measure email campaigns

This guide will walk you through using Umami to measure the impact and effectiveness of your email campaigns in driving business outcomes. It's important to note that Umami complements your email-sending tool, which you should use to track email deliverability performance, such as opens and clicks.

## Step 1: Setup event tracking

If you send email traffic to a page on your website with Umami installed, that page needs to be set up to track events. This is a crucial step as Umami can track events on your website, which is vital to understanding email campaign performance. We need to know how many people clicked a sign-up button, installed, downloaded, signed up, etc. There are two ways to record events in Umami: using the data attributes property or JavaScript. For additional information on how to set up event tracking using Umami, please refer to the documentation.

## Step 2: Add UTM parameters to your links

If you send email traffic to a page on your website, the links in your email need to have UTM parameters so you can measure which links, creative, campaigns, etc, are driving traffic.

URL w/ no UTM Parameters: `https://your-website.com`

URL w/ UTM Parameters: `https://your-website.com?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=April-2024`

Umami automatically captures the UTM parameters you have added to the end of your links. You can review that data inside your Umami dashboards or build a custom UTM report. Google has a free UTM link builder that anyone can use.

## Reading the data

Once events and UTMs are in place, measuring the impact and effectiveness of your email campaigns involves reviewing the data inside Umami. There are two places to look: Dashboards and Reports.

Your Umami dashboard will give you a quick snapshot of which events are being triggered. Remember that without filters, the dashboard shows all events across all pages. Click More (see screenshot below) to filter your data.

To filter your data to measure the impact and effectiveness of your email campaigns, click the Filter link at the top of the page, as shown in the screenshot below. You can slice and dice the data with filters to understand which email campaigns generate events.

Umami also allows you to build custom reports that will allow you to jump straight into the exact data view you are looking for. These are the four types of custom reports:

- **Insights**: Dive deeper into your data by using segments and filters.
- **Funnel**: Understand the conversion and drop-off rate of users.
- **Retention**: Measure your website stickiness by tracking how often users return.
- **UTM**: Track your campaigns through UTM parameters.

When you log in to Umami, click Reports along the top navigation to explore and start building your reports.

## Example

Let's review an example of how to measure the impact and effectiveness of your email campaign by using landing pages:

1. The first thing to do in Umami is view metrics on your email landing page by filtering by URL.
2. We can then use data filters to understand traffic via query parameters (UTM parameters) to determine how people arrived on the page, which links were clicked, and which email was clicked (maybe you have multiple emails in a sequence youâ€™re trying to track).
3. We can then use data filters to understand the events on the page. For example, has someone clicked the Get Started or Free Trial buttons?

You can then return to your leadership and recommend adjusting the marketing spend based on actual email campaign data. Also, when you determine what is producing the desired outcomes, you can go to leadership and ask for more budget because you will have the information and data you need to tell them the precise return on ad spend per channel.

## Conclusion

Using Umami to measure the impact and effectiveness of your email campaigns is a vital step in achieving your marketing goals. By setting up event tracking and adding UTM parameters to your links, you can gain valuable insights into your website's performance and attribute the success of your email campaigns to specific campaigns, creative, and more.
