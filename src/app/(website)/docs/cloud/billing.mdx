You can reveal your key by clicking on the `visible` icon in the text input.

## Using your key

You can access your Umami Cloud data by querying the following address.

`https://api.umami.is/v1`

Just pass in your API key via a custom header `x-umami-api-key`

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```sh
curl https://api.umami.is/v1/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "x-umami-api-key <api-key>"
```
